# Evolution
My first PC game


The purpose of this game was to learn C# and how I can create a game from pragraming. 
I had no piror knowlege of programming before this. 
Realize the importance of comments. 


_Problems:- 


I underestimate comments, therefore, didn't make any. 
Needs a loading screen and a better way to implement cutscens. uccrently scenses are loading too slow.  

# Story
A Clown Fish named, "Lalu" will go though series of events to get his beloved gold fish named, "Evelin" back from "The big bad whale" (aka BBW). 
fortunatly, Lalu's friend is a turtle who is remarkbly intelegent. He has a device called, "Milk from the surface" that will help lalu grow stronger to beat the BBW.


_Endings

There are two ending one is in which we find out that the turtle was just experimenting on us to control the sea.
And the other is in which we find out the truth about evelin. the gold fish is a gold digger and she willingly ran away with the BBW.
Thus explaining the morle of the story. Love is Evol but it's nessary for  Evolution. 

# Gameplay
The Player Fish will eat the smallest fish. Once the smallest fish has been eaten they will get a star which will indicating that they can eat the second level of fish. once second level fish are gone they will get another star indicating they can eat the third level of fish. 


The third level of fish will be the last fish. 


The food can only be the first level. 


There will be obsitile for example jelly fish, octopus, and eelss that the player fish can not touch. 


As the player fish eats it grows bigger and slower. (making the stage harder as you eat more)
